This is Quick Wiki.  It's a short proof of concept and education project I used
to teach myself QCubed, Memcache, LESS for CSS and the concepts of high performance
MySQL.  You're free to use any or all of it as you please, however, I don't expect
it to be useful except as example code.  It is not a feature complete wiki, but
rather a very basic one.
